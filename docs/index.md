# Buffy

## Introduction

_Buffy_ is a convenient motion picture title finder 
for audiences looking for viewing suggestions that 
match specific preferences, or for those who need help 
to remember the title of a film.  Users may select from a 
variety of search fields, inputting as much or as little 
information as they want, and _Buffy_ will return a list
of results that fit those parameters.  With _Buffy_, users 
have their very own personal film buff at their disposal
around the clock.

When _Buffy_ is started, users will be presented with a
screen of, ultimately, up to 15 different search fields, including
title, director, actor, writer, composer, studio, release
date, running time, genre, language, awards, and popular
keywords.  The more search fields utilized, the narrower
and more specific will be Buffy's returned list, which will
be displayed on a subsequent screen that allows for watchlisting titles, 
and archiving previous searches in the history, for later
perusing.  Each title will be accompanied by a link to 
a TMD page for logline browsing and trailer viewing, and ultimately
a link for online streaming.  With _Buffy_'s help, 
searching for a movie to watch is easier than ever.

## Intended Users

* Consumers who want to watch a movie with certain specific elements, and would like some title suggestions.

    > As a parent of five, who works 40 hours per week, I don't have the time to keep up with what new movies have been released, and I know I've missed many titles that would interest me.  I don't have the time to scroll endlessly through websites, and read descriptions of random movies hoping to find something to watch in the few free hours I have each week.  I need a way to filter through a set of specific preferences to return a small, targeted list of titles from which to choose.
	
* Consumers who want immediate assistance finding a specific film title.
	
	> As a movie buff it is very important to me to not forget the name of a film.  The other night I was out with friends and an old film came up in conversation, one that we all remembered obscure details about, but couldn't quite place the title.  If I had an app that could find the title based on a few details it would have come in handy that night.
